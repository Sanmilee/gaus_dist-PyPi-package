### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in contributing to the python pypi package. The gaus_dist package computes the Binomial and Gaussian  mean and std-dev of an input.



### File Descriptions
There are 3 major files in here, the Binomialdistribution.py which holds the binomial distribution operation. The Gaussiandistribution.py holds the binomial distribution operation and the Generaldistribution.py file is the driver file.



### Installation
The package is available [here.](https://pypi.org/project/gaus-dist/) and requires the following:
1. python 3
2. math
3. matplotlib

The package is installed by type the following command in cmd
- pip install gaus-dist


### Usage
on cmd:

- python
- from gaus_dist import Gaussian, Binomial
- Gaussian(10,7)
- Binomial(0.4,25)




### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
